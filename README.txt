Hello, Ben (or whoever else reads this), this is just a quick set-up guide if you want to use my chat program.

Requirements:
NodeJS (latest version)

Usage:
Open up a terminal in this directory. Type "node server.js" to initialize the server. Once the server has started, open a new terminal and type "node client.js" to join the server. For each chat user, you want to have client.js running in a terminal (e.x for 3 users, you need 1 terminal running server.js, and the others running client.js).
